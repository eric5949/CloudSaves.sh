# CloudSaves.sh
script for syncing saves for games that dont support steam cloud using nextcloud flatpak.

Lets you pick from a list of supported games or enter your own game and sycns them to a folder on cloud storage using symlinks and a systemd user service on a timer. 

Just download the files and run the script, it should ask for all the information required. No root necessary, I made this for the steamdeck.
